# Security Policy

At Platypus Finance, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. But even with such priority and maximum effort, there is still the possibility that vulnerabilities can exist. 

If you discover a vulnerability, please read our [bug bounty program details](https://github.com/platypus-finance/core/blob/master/bug-bounty.md)

    Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or similar problems you have discovered, including, but not limited to, testing the vulnerability on any network (includes testnet). 

    Do not reveal the vulnerability to others until it has been resolved, including, but not limited to, filing a public ticket mentioning the vulnerability. 
    
    Do provide sufficient information to reproduce the vulnerability, so we will be able to resolve it as quickly as possible. Complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation so we might ask you for additional information.
